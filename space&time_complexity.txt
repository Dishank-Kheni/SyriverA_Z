Time Complexity: The rate at which time taken increases with respect to the input size. 

It can be defined using three methoods.
1. Biga
2. Omega
3. Theta

Things to take care during calculating Time Complexity:
1. Always calculate Time Complexity with assuming worst case scenario
2. Avoid constant time
3. Avoid lower svalues

Big-oh (O) -> worst case [Upper-Bond]
Theta -> [Average Complexity]
Omega -> Best case[Lower-Bond]


Space Complexity: The memory space that program takes to complete task.

Auxilary Space: Space that take to solve the problem
Input Space: The space that you take to store the input

Space Complexity = Auxilary Space + Input Space (c= a+b)

Note: Never manipulate inpute data in order to save space.
